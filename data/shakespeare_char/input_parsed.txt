4/5/23, 16:23 - Elizabeth: wow i didnt know that 
4/5/23, 16:25 - Jasson: I meant the screen was already time's up
4/5/23, 16:25 - Elizabeth: . . .
4/5/23, 16:25 - Elizabeth: ok?
4/5/23, 16:30 - Yu Wei Tang: Indeed
4/5/23, 16:30 - Yu Wei Tang: I faces time itself
4/5/23, 16:31 - Yu Wei Tang: Einstien(I think) was the first to ask *what is time? "
4/5/23, 16:31 - Yu Wei Tang: He claims that if movement is relative, how would we know if something is moving if there's nothing to compare it to?
4/5/23, 16:31 - Yu Wei Tang: Then he concluded with "in short, what is time?"
4/5/23, 16:39 - Jasson: It is one of many illusions made by people in the real world trying to make us think the a "reality" we live in is real
4/5/23, 16:40 - Yu Wei Tang: That's true to a certain extent
4/5/23, 16:42 - Lucas: Well
4/5/23, 16:42 - Lucas: Technically time ain't real
4/5/23, 16:42 - Lucas: Cuz u can change time
4/5/23, 16:42 - Lucas: Which is what sg did
4/5/23, 16:43 - Jasson: Yeah time was just made up
4/5/23, 16:43 - Jasson: But the concept of time already existed
4/5/23, 16:44 - Yu Wei Tang: Not rlly
4/5/23, 16:44 - Yu Wei Tang: The measurement
4/5/23, 16:45 - Jasson: THERE IS NO PROOF ANYTHING IS REAL
4/5/23, 16:46 - Joshua: Except for Jasson x Nathanial
4/5/23, 16:46 - Joshua: Which is proven to be real
4/5/23, 16:46 - Jasson: NO
4/5/23, 16:47 - Elizabeth: . . .
4/5/23, 16:47 - Jasson: Nathaniel is with Gloria
4/5/23, 16:47 - Elizabeth: and i thought yall couldnt get any weirder
4/5/23, 16:47 - Joshua: Okok
4/5/23, 16:47 - Jasson: They are the only people who knows each others passwords after they both changed it
4/5/23, 16:48 - Joshua: iloveAHS1234
4/5/23, 16:48 - Jasson: ALSO THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT REALITY IS REAL SO NOTHING CAN BE PROVEN
4/5/23, 16:49 - Joshua: Which means that 1+1 could equal 69
4/5/23, 16:49 - Jasson: WHICH MEANS MATH COULD ALL JUST BE A LIE
4/5/23, 16:50 - Joshua: <Media omitted>
4/5/23, 16:51 - Jasson: IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVEN IF EVERYTHING IN THIS REALITY IS REAL MATH IS STILL MADE UP
4/5/23, 16:51 - Jasson: SAME WITH SCIENCE
4/5/23, 16:52 - Jasson: AND LANGUAGES
4/5/23, 16:52 - Joshua: AND HUMANITIES
4/5/23, 16:52 - Jasson: ONLY HISTORY
4/5/23, 16:52 - Joshua: Why
4/5/23, 16:53 - Joshua: You hate Ms Huang isit
4/5/23, 16:53 - Jasson: cuz history is about the past
4/5/23, 16:54 - Joshua: How about literature
4/5/23, 16:54 - Jasson: It happened in this reality
4/5/23, 16:54 - Joshua: Literature and Geography too
4/5/23, 16:54 - Jasson: Literature is from a language and language is made up by a random person
4/5/23, 16:55 - Yu Wei Tang: Actually lly
4/5/23, 16:55 - Yu Wei Tang: This(if I'm not wrong) is a realqn in philosophy
4/5/23, 16:56 - Yu Wei Tang: Some might say
4/5/23, 16:56 - Joshua: <Media omitted>
4/5/23, 16:56 - Yu Wei Tang: "just look around you"
4/5/23, 16:56 - Yu Wei Tang: And? Eyes can deceive
4/5/23, 16:56 - Jasson: Geography is partially true if everything is actually what it is but there are many factors of geo that is proven by science and science isn't proven by anything
4/5/23, 16:56 - Yu Wei Tang: In fact all sensory organs are untrusable of sorts
4/5/23, 16:56 - Yu Wei Tang: Hence
4/5/23, 16:56 - Joshua: It's proven by experiments
4/5/23, 16:56 - Yu Wei Tang: We don't actually know if anyt it real
4/5/23, 16:57 - Yu Wei Tang: But there's some qns within this qn
4/5/23, 16:57 - Joshua: Which means tandas might not be real
4/5/23, 16:57 - Joshua: 
4/5/23, 16:57 - Yu Wei Tang: If this is true, then how do we "know" Abt it?
4/5/23, 16:57 - Jasson: And experiments are proven by science
4/5/23, 16:57 - Yu Wei Tang: How can other ppl tell us so?
4/5/23, 16:57 - Jasson: So what if they are both wrong
4/5/23, 16:58 - Jasson: I feel like we're starting a religion
4/5/23, 16:58 - Joshua: We should call it tandasm
4/5/23, 16:59 - Joshua: Or tandasisim
4/5/23, 16:59 - Yu Wei Tang: Started alr actually it's called conspiracy theorism
4/5/23, 16:59 - Joshua: No it's called tandasism
4/5/23, 16:59 - Jasson: No the world is a conspiracy
4/5/23, 17:00 - Yu Wei Tang: Can't believe I go to sleep thinking Abt these qns

4/5/23, 17:00 - Joshua: You deleted this message
4/5/23, 17:00 - Jasson: There is nothing proving that what we believe in is real so reality can be whatever it is
4/5/23, 17:00 - Jasson: Hey
4/5/23, 17:00 - Yu Wei Tang: Dare I say logic of a too far extent doesn't go hand in hand with emotions
4/5/23, 17:00 - Joshua: This isn't even real
4/5/23, 17:00 - Yu Wei Tang: I will sue you under pofma
4/5/23, 17:01 - Jasson: Did you get permission for this stickers
4/5/23, 17:01 - Joshua: Pofma isn't real

6/5/23, 16:46 - Yu Wei Tang: Some survived not the treacherous journey
6/5/23, 16:51 - Jasson: Eng, lit and i-score are vastly superior to PE (Wednesday)

6/5/23, 16:51 - Jasson: It is
6/5/23, 16:53 - Jasson: Seriously, I expected a worse reaction

6/5/23, 17:01 - Jasson: K-pop is just made of random sounds with random English words put in
6/5/23, 17:01 - Yu Wei Tang: Chill

6/5/23, 17:12 - Jasson: T y
6/5/23, 17:12 - Yu Wei Tang: Don't use bombastic and unnecessary words
6/5/23, 17:12 - Yu Wei Tang: Grammarly
6/5/23, 17:12 - Jasson: Okay
6/5/23, 17:13 - Jasson: So since a fucking army of K-pop fans have invaded the answers, heres an answer from my perspective:

+ Manufactured, generic music

+ Cringy fandom

+ The truckload of people calling you racist for not liking K-pop -> so am I supposed to call you racist for not liking Indian classical music?

+ Being called homophobic -> Dislike of k-pop does not indicate homophobia.

So lets hypothesize with some amount of rationale here. By this logic, not liking reggae makes you racist. By this logic, not liking BTS makes you a homophobe.

The music genuinely sounds like trash to anyone whos studied music seriously, there is no sense of musical depth, there is absolute zero in terms of what makes it a great song.

Then again you have the marketing genius of the managers who manage to create such a dedicated fandom, to the point that if you dont like a certain genre you are a racist, insensitive piece of shit who deserves to die.

Have you ever heard of Robert Johnson? He was an actual musician who got poisoned. He suffered his entire life because of actual racism, yet he is practically one of the founders of blues and rock (along with Muddy Waters).

But the massive army of KPop stans last time I checked havent spent years of their life studying music in multiple forms, so might as well accept it.
6/5/23, 17:13 - Joshua: https://youtu.be/iwbvWDoF1d4
Better kpop
6/5/23, 17:13 - audrey: about the racist thing
6/5/23, 17:13 - audrey: indian classical music isnt pop
6/5/23, 17:13 - audrey: and kpop is pop but korean
6/5/23, 17:13 - Jasson: This is real music
6/5/23, 17:13 - Yu Wei Tang: Don't curse
6/5/23, 17:14 - audrey: i agree with the cringy fandom but that doesnt mean u can criticise the music
6/5/23, 17:14 - Joshua: Yeah lor Jasson
6/5/23, 17:14 - Jasson: We do it all the time though
6/5/23, 17:14 - Yu Wei Tang: Fair point I take back my words

13/5/23, 14:25 - audrey: its a card not just a selfie
13/5/23, 14:26 - Jasson: No it's a thirst trap
13/5/23, 14:26 - Yu Wei Tang: It's a laminated picture of a selfie
13/5/23, 14:26 - audrey: yeah
13/5/23, 14:26 - Yu Wei Tang: So
13/5/23, 14:26 - Yu Wei Tang: Paper+plastic that's <50g =$250
13/5/23, 14:26 - Jasson: The only people buying these things are simps
13/5/23, 14:27 - audrey: its a rare photocard
13/5/23, 14:27 - Yu Wei Tang: It's a selfie
13/5/23, 14:27 - Yu Wei Tang: You can go to their social media and print it urself
13/5/23, 14:27 - Jasson: It's a thirst trap of a prostitute
13/5/23, 14:27 - audrey: but it doesnt feel the same anymore
13/5/23, 14:28 - audrey: like no value
13/5/23, 14:28 - Yu Wei Tang: So what's the process the selfie goes thru
13/5/23, 14:28 - Yu Wei Tang: 1. They take a selfie
13/5/23, 14:28 - Yu Wei Tang: 2. They print it
13/5/23, 14:28 - Yu Wei Tang: 3. They laminate it
13/5/23, 14:28 - Yu Wei Tang: I don't tink the type of printer or type of plastic or paper it is printed with changes its value by >100$
13/5/23, 14:29 - Jasson: Lmao
13/5/23, 14:29 - Jasson: No dumbass would buy such a thing
13/5/23, 14:29 - Joshua: It's because there are a lot of simps
13/5/23, 14:29 - Joshua: Supply and demand
13/5/23, 14:29 - audrey: i mean its the fan that decides the price
13/5/23, 14:29 - Yu Wei Tang: All of u shut up
13/5/23, 14:29 - Joshua: No
13/5/23, 14:29 - audrey: like on carou its $20-$70

13/5/23, 14:29 - audrey: uh
13/5/23, 14:29 - Jasson: This is bull shit
13/5/23, 14:30 - Joshua: Yeah
13/5/23, 14:30 - Yu Wei Tang: Guys
13/5/23, 14:30 - Joshua: @6588389539 explain
13/5/23, 14:30 - Yu Wei Tang: Let Audrey prove her point
13/5/23, 14:30 - Yu Wei Tang: Then we attack by finding holes in her explanation
13/5/23, 14:30 - Joshua: Yes. Everyone else shut up
13/5/23, 14:30 - audrey: so u see these photocards are limited
13/5/23, 14:30 - Yu Wei Tang: /hj
13/5/23, 14:30 - audrey: like u can only find them in korea
13/5/23, 14:30 - Jasson: I photo of someone is limited
13/5/23, 14:30 - audrey: its the card.
13/5/23, 14:31 - Joshua: Which Korea
13/5/23, 14:31 - Yu Wei Tang: How can it be limited
13/5/23, 14:31 - Yu Wei Tang: Explain
13/5/23, 14:31 - Jasson: You have millions of photos of that person
13/5/23, 14:31 - Joshua: You aren't clear enough
13/5/23, 14:31 - Jasson: Obviously East and West
13/5/23, 14:31 - audrey: theres this survival show called boys planet and the final episode got aired at a theatre and only the ppl at the theatre gets the photocard set
13/5/23, 14:32 - Jasson: Wut
13/5/23, 14:32 - Yu Wei Tang: And how does that show it's limited
13/5/23, 14:32 - audrey: its hard to explain
13/5/23, 14:32 - audrey: wait
13/5/23, 14:32 - Yu Wei Tang: Printers exist
13/5/23, 14:32 - Jasson: Are you stupid or something
13/5/23, 14:32 - Joshua: It's like nfts or something probably
13/5/23, 14:32 - Jasson: No nfts are dead
13/5/23, 14:32 - Yu Wei Tang: Woa woa no foul language in the court of 1c
13/5/23, 14:32 - Joshua: Ya
13/5/23, 14:33 - audrey: okay but like if u print pokemon cards does it feel the same as the pokemon cards u buy
13/5/23, 14:33 - Jasson: Wut how that foul
13/5/23, 14:33 - Joshua: But I think the kpop cards are a lot like nfts
13/5/23, 14:33 - Yu Wei Tang: Pokemon cards have no value to me
13/5/23, 14:33 - audrey: oh
13/5/23, 14:33 - audrey: uh
13/5/23, 14:33 - Jasson: No because you can't use them in tournaments
13/5/23, 14:33 - Yu Wei Tang: Ur poving her point
13/5/23, 14:33 - Yu Wei Tang: And
13/5/23, 14:33 - Joshua: It has no value itself
But everyone wants it
13/5/23, 14:33 - Yu Wei Tang: You could replicate one
13/5/23, 14:33 - Joshua: Because it's the original copy or something
13/5/23, 14:33 - Joshua: I don't know
13/5/23, 14:34 - audrey: its the same thing with money
13/5/23, 14:34 - Jasson: Oh, then people sell fake pokemon cards and people buy them knowing it's fake
13/5/23, 14:34 - audrey: if u print money urself then theres like no value
13/5/23, 14:34 - Jasson: No you use money to buy things
13/5/23, 14:34 - Jasson: The card is useless
13/5/23, 14:35 - Joshua: You can sell it for money
13/5/23, 14:35 - Yu Wei Tang: Bc two pieces of money cannot be 100% the same, but once you change something that is different in all bills, and avoid government, then it will have value
13/5/23, 14:35 - audrey: i have no idea what ur saying 
13/5/23, 14:35 - Joshua: But you'll go to jail
13/5/23, 14:35 - Yu Wei Tang: Ofc you don't
13/5/23, 14:35 - Jasson: No it's useless in the sense that it cannot be used unless given away
13/5/23, 14:36 - Yu Wei Tang: Money works in a sense of belief
13/5/23, 14:36 - Jasson: Money works but the economy
13/5/23, 14:36 - Yu Wei Tang: Money's value is because people think that it has value, despite it not actually having value
13/5/23, 14:36 - Joshua: Actually, due to inflation, if you print more money, the value of money would decrease
13/5/23, 14:37 - Jasson: It's the amount of money that gives it value
13/5/23, 14:37 - Joshua: Ya
13/5/23, 14:37 - Jasson: No it's not the amount of money but the measurements used
13/5/23, 14:38 - Joshua: Whatndo you mean
13/5/23, 14:38 - Joshua: The money we are using now is actually Fiat money, which is bad. We should return to the gold standard.
13/5/23, 14:38 - Jasson: I mean math
13/5/23, 14:39 - Joshua: What measurements are you talking about
13/5/23, 14:39 - Jasson: If cards have money that can be traded why have anything on the card
13/5/23, 14:43 - Joshua: Because people believe it has value
13/5/23, 14:43 - Joshua: Like money
13/5/23, 14:43 - Joshua: And the value of the card is determined by the amount of that item and the amount of people who want it, or supply and demNd
13/5/23, 14:44 - Joshua: <Media omitted>
13/5/23, 14:44 - audrey: its bc if theres nothing on it then no one wants to buy it
13/5/23, 14:44 - Joshua: Because no one believes it has value so they won't buy it
13/5/23, 14:45 - Joshua: Although I find that they don't have value
13/5/23, 14:46 - audrey: <Media omitted>
13/5/23, 14:47 - Joshua: It's only because you and other simps believe the glass rabbit has value
13/5/23, 14:48 - audrey: i honestly dont know why it has more value but alot of ppl want it
13/5/23, 14:49 - Joshua: It has high demand
13/5/23, 14:49 - Joshua: And the supply is probably very low
13/5/23, 14:49 - Joshua: Probably they made very few
13/5/23, 14:49 - Joshua: <Media omitted>
13/5/23, 14:49 - Jasson: The difference between crypto currency and collector cards are that cards are a joke
13/5/23, 14:49 - Joshua: Therefore it's overpriced
13/5/23, 14:50 - Joshua: But they both are scams
13/5/23, 14:50 - audrey: i dont think so I think they make equal amounts but its just that hes a popular member
13/5/23, 14:50 - Jasson: Yes, crypto is a scam but collector cards is a stupid scam
13/5/23, 14:51 - Joshua: So higher demand and same supply would mean the cost is higher
13/5/23, 14:51 - Joshua: They are both overhyped
13/5/23, 14:53 - audrey: yes
13/5/23, 14:56 - Jasson: The reason other things that are worth a lot aren't scams is because they were originally products that could be used for useful stuff but eventually after a long time the amount of these products in a good condition decreased so they are worth more and hence are not scams
13/5/23, 14:56 - Joshua: Yeah
13/5/23, 14:56 - Joshua: Supply decreased but demand stayed the same

18/5/23, 20:09 - Joshua: 0.5/0
18/5/23, 20:12 - Joshua: As the profit margin is undefined, therefore by selling it @6586965532 is breaking the laws of msths
18/5/23, 20:12 - Joshua: Maths
18/5/23, 20:23 - Joshua: Also, not only is this against the laws of mathematics, this is also against the laws of Singapore
18/5/23, 20:23 - Joshua: The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003
18/5/23, 20:26 - Joshua: This is under making a false claim

18/5/23, 20:30 - Joshua: As lim x ( 1/x ) = 0
18/5/23, 20:31 - Joshua: Since he is selling it at $0.50, it is sold at an extremely high markup as 0.5/0 is an extremely large number
18/5/23, 20:31 - Yung Hann: I'll steal geo raps job

18/5/23, 20:44 - Joshua: I don't want to spam photos anymore
18/5/23, 20:44 - Joshua: Voluntary compliance agreement
8.(1) Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a supplier has engaged, is engaging or is likely to engage in an unfair practice, a specified body may invite the supplier to enter into a voluntary compliance agreement.
(2) The voluntary compliance agreement must 
(a) be in writing; and
(b) include an undertaking that the supplier will not engage in the unfair practice.
(3) Subject to subsection (5), the specified body may (with the agreement of the supplier) include in a voluntary compliance agreement all or any of the following undertakings by the supplier:
(a) to compensate any consumer who has suffered loss or damage as a result of an unfair practice;
(b) to reimburse any specified body for any costs or expenses incurred by it;
(c) to publicise the voluntary compliance agreement,
in the manner or upon the terms specified in the undertakings.
18/5/23, 20:49 - Joshua: Lucas also broke the Control of Essential Supplies Act
18/5/23, 20:50 - Joshua: Offence to sell controlled articles without a licence or permit
16. Any person, not being the holder of a valid licence or permit issued in accordance with section 7, who, either on his own behalf or on behalf of any body corporate of which he is a director or officer or on behalf of any firm of which he is a partner, sells by wholesale or retail any controlled article or any person, being the holder of any such licence or permit, who so sells any controlled article in any premises or at a place other than the premises or place specified in the licence or permit, or who so sells any controlled article contrary to any conditions expressed in the licence or permit, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.
18/5/23, 20:51 - Joshua: Penalties
22.(1) Any person, other than a body corporate, but including a director or officer of a body corporate, who commits an offence under this Act shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both, and in the case of a second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.
18/5/23, 20:53 - Joshua: I will give him max sentence because I'm lazy
18/5/23, 20:55 - Joshua: Therefore, for breaking the Control of Essential Supplies Act, The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003, and the laws of Mathematics, Lucas is imprisoned for 2 years, has to pay a fine of $10,000, and has to pay us $0.50

20/5/23, 16:21 - Yu Wei Tang: Jasson abit
20/5/23, 16:21 - Yu Wei Tang: Short for it
20/5/23, 16:21 - Yu Wei Tang: We need ppl of similar heights
20/5/23, 16:21 - Yu Wei Tang: Eg
20/5/23, 16:21 - Joshua: No he's 200cm
20/5/23, 16:23 - Yu Wei Tang: Bryan Elliot Elvin rui an ryner reyden Xavier Yung hann
20/5/23, 16:30 - Joshua: They should all do that
20/5/23, 16:57 - Lucas: <Media omitted>
20/5/23, 16:58 - Elizabeth: u hv to write statement bru
20/5/23, 16:59 - Lucas: What kinda
20/5/23, 16:59 - Lucas: Teach me
20/5/23, 16:59 - Elizabeth: like example u write
Distance the ____ travels=20km/h
20/5/23, 17:00 - Elizabeth: that kinda thing
20/5/23, 17:00 - Lucas: Ok
20/5/23, 17:00 - Elizabeth: idk the qn so
20/5/23, 17:03 - Yu Wei Tang: They asked for GRADIENT if I'm not wrong
20/5/23, 17:03 - Yu Wei Tang: You're writing his speed
20/5/23, 17:03 - Yu Wei Tang: Hence
20/5/23, 17:03 - Yu Wei Tang: No ATQ
20/5/23, 17:04 - Lucas: Uhhhh
20/5/23, 17:04 - Lucas: THE GRADIENT IS SPEED
20/5/23, 17:04 - Jasson: You know I'm the average height for someone in the 18th century or a North Korean 14 year old
20/5/23, 17:04 - Yu Wei Tang: In this case
20/5/23, 17:04 - Yu Wei Tang: However
20/5/23, 17:04 - Yu Wei Tang: Gradient can be negative
20/5/23, 17:04 - Yu Wei Tang: Speed cannot be negative
20/5/23, 17:04 - Yu Wei Tang: Therefore
20/5/23, 17:04 - Yu Wei Tang: Gradientspeed
20/5/23, 17:05 - Lucas: I will prove it with physics
20/5/23, 17:05 - Lucas: Jk
20/5/23, 17:05 - Lucas: Just gostun
20/5/23, 17:05 - Yu Wei Tang: What are u gonna walk backwards
20/5/23, 17:05 - Lucas: How did uk
20/5/23, 17:05 - Jasson: That's distance
20/5/23, 17:06 - Lucas: Ye
20/5/23, 17:06 - Lucas: If dis is neg
20/5/23, 17:06 - Lucas: Time is ps
20/5/23, 17:06 - Lucas: Then speed wld be neg
20/5/23, 17:06 - Lucas: Wait a min
20/5/23, 17:06 - Lucas: I BROKE PHYSICS
20/5/23, 17:07 - Yu Wei Tang: Bro
20/5/23, 17:07 - Yu Wei Tang: Explain negative distance
20/5/23, 17:07 - Lucas: Backwards cycling
20/5/23, 17:07 - Lucas: Reverse gear
20/5/23, 17:07 - Yu Wei Tang: You're moving a positive distance, just facing the other way
20/5/23, 17:08 - Lucas: Technically no
20/5/23, 17:08 - Lucas: Can we argue later
20/5/23, 17:08 - Lucas: I need the ans
20/5/23, 17:09 - Lucas: @yu
20/5/23, 17:09 - Lucas: @6580245644
20/5/23, 17:09 - Yu Wei Tang: Un
20/5/23, 17:09 - Yu Wei Tang: Um
20/5/23, 17:09 - Yu Wei Tang: Wrong statement
20/5/23, 17:09 - Yu Wei Tang: Also negative gradients are negative
20/5/23, 17:10 - Yu Wei Tang: Have to write Abt gradient
20/5/23, 17:10 - Lucas: JUST GIMME HOW TO WRITE THE STATEMENT
20/5/23, 17:10 - Yu Wei Tang: You can just write gradient OA (for example)=dadada
20/5/23, 17:11 - Lucas: What dadada
20/5/23, 17:11 - Yu Wei Tang: Like whatever lor
20/5/23, 17:11 - Awldan: What is the highest point of p u can get
20/5/23, 17:11 - Yu Wei Tang: Ur answers r correct
20/5/23, 17:11 - Lucas: Hih
20/5/23, 17:11 - Yu Wei Tang: ?
20/5/23, 17:11 - Lucas: Huh
20/5/23, 17:11 - Awldan: P for the math thing
20/5/23, 17:11 - Yu Wei Tang: Idk leh
20/5/23, 17:11 - Lucas: 3
20/5/23, 17:11 - Awldan: <Media omitted>
20/5/23, 17:11 - Yu Wei Tang: That's ur ans
20/5/23, 17:11 - Lucas: Presentation
20/5/23, 17:11 - Awldan: O
20/5/23, 17:11 - Lucas: 3
20/5/23, 17:11 - Awldan: O
20/5/23, 17:12 - Yu Wei Tang: L
20/5/23, 17:12 - Lucas: This message was deleted
20/5/23, 17:12 - Yu Wei Tang: Bozo
20/5/23, 17:12 - Yu Wei Tang: Wait I thought c2
20/5/23, 17:12 - Lucas: Shaddup
20/5/23, 17:12 - Yu Wei Tang: Wait no c1 is better ain't iti
20/5/23, 17:12 - Yu Wei Tang: Idk
20/5/23, 17:12 - Yu Wei Tang: Either way
20/5/23, 17:12 - Yu Wei Tang: Just do ur he and do what Mr teo says
20/5/23, 17:13 - Lucas: <Media omitted>
20/5/23, 17:16 - Lucas: Yu we8
20/5/23, 17:16 - Lucas: Yu wei
20/5/23, 17:16 - Lucas: Although what u said abt distance is correct
20/5/23, 17:16 - Lucas: I have a theory
20/5/23, 17:16 - Lucas: @6580245644
20/5/23, 17:17 - Lucas: If u put two things in the universe space
20/5/23, 17:17 - Lucas: <Media omitted>
20/5/23, 17:18 - Lucas: The green one is the longest
20/5/23, 17:19 - Lucas: And since the green can be infinity
20/5/23, 17:19 - Lucas: And infinity can be converted to negative infinity
20/5/23, 17:19 - Lucas: Technically the dist would be negative infinity
20/5/23, 17:21 - Lucas: Tbh this doesn't sound right so um if anyone wanna counter attack pls do
20/5/23, 17:21 - Joshua: What is happening
20/5/23, 17:21 - Lucas: I'm proving negative distance
20/5/23, 17:21 - Joshua: Also the thing is infinity isn't even a number
20/5/23, 17:21 - Lucas: Ik
20/5/23, 17:22 - Joshua: It's an idea
20/5/23, 17:22 - Lucas: It's more the any real number
20/5/23, 17:22 - Lucas: Not only
20/5/23, 17:22 - Lucas: It's a theory
20/5/23, 17:22 - Lucas: And a theory on a theory is a theory
20/5/23, 17:23 - Lucas: So my theory is
20/5/23, 17:23 - Lucas: Negative infinity dist is possible
20/5/23, 17:23 - Lucas: @6580245644
20/5/23, 17:23 - Lucas: Can u prove me wrong pls
20/5/23, 17:23 - Lucas: I need to refine on this
20/5/23, 17:27 - Lucas: If it's only a idea then space-time relativity would also only be an idea
20/5/23, 17:28 - Joshua: They are both theroies
20/5/23, 17:28 - Lucas: Exactly
20/5/23, 17:28 - Lucas: So technically I can make a theory based on another one
20/5/23, 17:29 - Lucas: I finally used my brain half(?)(more or less prolly less)(I randomly came up with it) pontential
20/5/23, 17:30 - Joshua: However, this is only theoretically possible
20/5/23, 17:31 - Lucas: Exactly
20/5/23, 17:31 - Lucas: So it's a theory
20/5/23, 17:31 - Lucas: YESSSSSSSSS
20/5/23, 17:32 - Joshua: Anyway I'm going to make html code for my own hunger games simulator
20/5/23, 17:34 - Lucas: Ok
20/5/23, 17:36 - Lucas: I need to show this to Mr teo
20/5/23, 17:36 - Joshua: I approve of this argument
20/5/23, 17:36 - Lucas: This is a research breakthrough
20/5/23, 17:36 - Joshua: Because I put negative distance as well
20/5/23, 17:36 - Lucas: And Joshua approved
20/5/23, 17:36 - Lucas: High five joshua
20/5/23, 17:36 - Lucas: I didnt
20/5/23, 17:36 - Lucas: But I think it's possible
20/5/23, 17:37 - Joshua: @6586965532 you did
20/5/23, 17:38 - Joshua: Actually that was speed
20/5/23, 17:38 - Joshua: actually I did put negative speed
20/5/23, 17:38 - Lucas: No
20/5/23, 17:38 - Lucas: Neg dist leads to neg speed
20/5/23, 17:39 - Lucas: This message was deleted
20/5/23, 17:52 - Yu Wei Tang: Hold your horses
20/5/23, 17:52 - Yu Wei Tang: Shortest dist from what
20/5/23, 17:52 - Lucas: Each other
20/5/23, 17:52 - Yu Wei Tang: Lemme read it hol on
20/5/23, 17:53 - Yu Wei Tang: Green is not infinity
20/5/23, 17:53 - Yu Wei Tang: The observable universe is NOT infinite
20/5/23, 17:53 - Lucas: Huh
20/5/23, 17:53 - Lucas: I didn't say observable
20/5/23, 17:53 - Lucas: Idiot
20/5/23, 17:53 - Yu Wei Tang: Hm
20/5/23, 17:53 - Yu Wei Tang: That's moving on to theoretical liao
20/5/23, 17:54 - Lucas: Why did u think I thought b4 phrasing that sentence
20/5/23, 17:54 - Lucas: Exactly
20/5/23, 17:54 - Yu Wei Tang: So this is an assumption that the universe is infinite
20/5/23, 17:54 - Lucas: It's alr a theory
20/5/23, 17:54 - Yu Wei Tang: Wdym  can be converted itno -
20/5/23, 17:54 - Lucas: Else count the multiverse
20/5/23, 17:54 - Lucas: Think abt it
20/5/23, 17:54 - Yu Wei Tang: Nvr heard of it but I'll take ur word
20/5/23, 17:54 - Lucas: Wait
20/5/23, 17:54 - Yu Wei Tang: I'm not sure I follow
20/5/23, 17:54 - Lucas: Lemme search
20/5/23, 17:55 - Yu Wei Tang: No thx
20/5/23, 17:55 - Yu Wei Tang: Ill take ur word
20/5/23, 17:56 - Lucas: Uhm
20/5/23, 17:56 - Lucas: It might not be
20/5/23, 17:56 - Yu Wei Tang: Are u saying that =-
20/5/23, 17:56 - Lucas: But just count the multiverse then
20/5/23, 17:56 - Lucas: This is the part where I confused myself
20/5/23, 17:56 - Yu Wei Tang: So
20/5/23, 17:57 - Yu Wei Tang: Wym when u say  can be converted into -
20/5/23, 17:57 - Lucas: Wait
20/5/23, 17:58 - Lucas: The reason I came up was
20/5/23, 17:58 - Lucas: Due to infinity not stating must be positive or negative
20/5/23, 17:58 - Lucas: They can be interchangeable
20/5/23, 17:58 - Yu Wei Tang: Youre saying that =-
20/5/23, 17:58 - Yu Wei Tang: Which is it true?
20/5/23, 17:59 - Lucas: Idk
20/5/23, 17:59 - Yu Wei Tang: X=-x only if x=0
20/5/23, 17:59 - Lucas: Prolly not
20/5/23, 17:59 - Yu Wei Tang: If x is a real no idk if there are other solutions
20/5/23, 17:59 - Yu Wei Tang: So
20/5/23, 17:59 - Yu Wei Tang: Let's define infinity shall we
20/5/23, 18:00 - Yu Wei Tang: There are dif infinites
20/5/23, 18:00 - Yu Wei Tang: Smallest one id aleph null
20/5/23, 18:00 - Yu Wei Tang: Which is 1+2+3+4+5+6
20/5/23, 18:00 - Joshua: This is actually -1/12
20/5/23, 18:01 - Lucas: Alright
20/5/23, 18:01 - Yu Wei Tang: Er
20/5/23, 18:01 - Yu Wei Tang: Hm
20/5/23, 18:01 - Yu Wei Tang: Lemme see eq
20/5/23, 18:01 - Lucas: Huh
20/5/23, 18:01 - Lucas: Huh what is eq
20/5/23, 18:01 - Lucas: Huh
20/5/23, 18:02 - Yu Wei Tang: Rq*
20/5/23, 18:02 - Yu Wei Tang: Watch value
20/5/23, 18:02 - Yu Wei Tang: Vsauce*
20/5/23, 18:02 - Yu Wei Tang: Also joshua
20/5/23, 18:02 - Yu Wei Tang: 1+2+3+4+5-1/12
20/5/23, 18:02 - Joshua: Ramanujan Summation
20/5/23, 18:03 - Lucas: Obv
20/5/23, 18:03 - Yu Wei Tang: Wait
20/5/23, 18:03 - Yu Wei Tang: My jc freind said it is
20/5/23, 18:03 - Yu Wei Tang: Just look it up
20/5/23, 18:03 - Yu Wei Tang: Either way
20/5/23, 18:04 - Yu Wei Tang: We have true infinity
20/5/23, 18:04 - Yu Wei Tang: Which if I'm not wrong
20/5/23, 18:04 - Yu Wei Tang: Is the sum of all positive numbers
20/5/23, 18:04 - Joshua: Including all fractions and decimals
20/5/23, 18:04 - Yu Wei Tang: Like 0.000000001+0.001+0.001
20/5/23, 18:04 - Yu Wei Tang: Ya
20/5/23, 18:04 - Yu Wei Tang: True infitit is impossible to perceive
20/5/23, 18:05 - Joshua: But shouldn't the true true infinity be 0
20/5/23, 18:05 - Joshua: Because that's the sum of e everything
20/5/23, 18:05 - Yu Wei Tang: If I'm not wrong
20/5/23, 18:05 - Yu Wei Tang:  is the sum of all POSITIVE numbers
20/5/23, 18:06 - Lucas: Ye
20/5/23, 18:06 - Lucas: Um
20/5/23, 18:06 - Lucas: Idek wat yall saying
20/5/23, 18:06 - Lucas: Yes
20/5/23, 18:06 - Lucas: Wait
20/5/23, 18:06 - Joshua: Yeah
20/5/23, 18:06 - Lucas: Oh cmon
20/5/23, 18:06 - Lucas: Wait a minute
20/5/23, 18:06 - Lucas: But
20/5/23, 18:07 - Lucas: All positive includes infinty
20/5/23, 18:07 - Yu Wei Tang: Infinity is not a number
20/5/23, 18:07 - Yu Wei Tang: It is a concept
20/5/23, 18:07 - Lucas: Ik
20/5/23, 18:07 - Yu Wei Tang: Therefore we cannot add infinity
20/5/23, 18:07 - Joshua: <Media omitted>
20/5/23, 18:07 - Yu Wei Tang: Therefore this is wrong
20/5/23, 18:07 - Yu Wei Tang: Infidelity ofc
20/5/23, 18:08 - Joshua: It's an idea
20/5/23, 18:08 - Yu Wei Tang: Ya
20/5/23, 18:08 - Joshua: ~like you to wei han~
20/5/23, 18:08 - Lucas: But
20/5/23, 18:08 - Lucas: It's included as positive
20/5/23, 18:08 - Lucas: So infinity being all pos is wrong
20/5/23, 18:09 - Yu Wei Tang: How so
20/5/23, 18:09 - Lucas: .
20/5/23, 18:09 - Yu Wei Tang: ?
20/5/23, 18:09 - Yu Wei Tang: Actually since 1+2+3+4+5 is -1/12
20/5/23, 18:09 - Yu Wei Tang: Then what is infinity
20/5/23, 18:09 - Lucas: Ou how
20/5/23, 18:09 - Yu Wei Tang: Why am I confusing myself lmao
20/5/23, 18:10 - Yu Wei Tang: I heard
20/5/23, 18:10 - Joshua: ~Awak sangat suka mencium lelaki lain.~
20/5/23, 18:10 - Lucas: Wait
20/5/23, 18:10 - Lucas: Then
20/5/23, 18:10 - Lucas: Infinity wouldn't be possible
20/5/23, 18:10 - Yu Wei Tang: It isn't
20/5/23, 18:10 - Lucas: But again
20/5/23, 18:10 - Lucas: If this is true
20/5/23, 18:11 - Lucas: Then add them all up
20/5/23, 18:11 - Yu Wei Tang: I'll revisit this later
20/5/23, 18:11 - Yu Wei Tang: I'm gonna eat dinner
20/5/23, 18:11 - Joshua: So aleph null isn't real
20/5/23, 18:11 - Joshua: So early?
20/5/23, 18:11 - Lucas: Can care explain whats aleph null
20/5/23, 18:12 - Lucas: It's a neg no
20/5/23, 18:12 - Lucas: And that's the dist
20/5/23, 18:12 - Joshua: 1+2+3...
20/5/23, 18:12 - Lucas: So mathematically dist is still neg
20/5/23, 18:12 - Yu Wei Tang: Um
20/5/23, 18:12 - Yu Wei Tang: I'll ask my friend
20/5/23, 18:13 - Lucas: Ok
20/5/23, 18:13 - Joshua: The jc one?
20/5/23, 18:13 - Lucas: Lolz
20/5/23, 18:14 - Lucas: Joshua
20/5/23, 18:14 - Lucas: I don't think we shld confuse the rest here
20/5/23, 18:14 - Lucas: Their brain might not take it
20/5/23, 18:14 - Joshua: Both aleph null and ramanujan summation are opposing views
20/5/23, 18:14 - Joshua: Ok
20/5/23, 18:14 - Lucas: Oh
20/5/23, 18:15 - Yu Wei Tang: Wait
20/5/23, 18:15 - Yu Wei Tang: Back to the first thing u said
20/5/23, 18:16 - Yu Wei Tang: =-
20/5/23, 18:16 - Lucas: Yes
20/5/23, 18:16 - Yu Wei Tang: So distance can be negative ONLY IF the distance is 
20/5/23, 18:16 - Lucas: No
20/5/23, 18:16 - Lucas: I said they r interchangeable
20/5/23, 18:16 - Lucas: Yes
20/5/23, 18:16 - Lucas: But that is still neg
20/5/23, 18:17 - Yu Wei Tang: However the distance is NOT
20/5/23, 18:17 - Yu Wei Tang: Hence
20/5/23, 18:17 - Yu Wei Tang: Speed must be positive
20/5/23, 18:17 - Yu Wei Tang: Unless it is infinity
20/5/23, 18:17 - Lucas: Bro
20/5/23, 18:17 - Joshua: No
20/5/23, 18:17 - Lucas: He asked the class if distance can be negative
20/5/23, 18:17 - Lucas: And said no
20/5/23, 18:17 - Joshua: Speed is distance/time
20/5/23, 18:17 - Lucas: So I wanted to challenge
20/5/23, 18:17 - Lucas: And if time could be neg
20/5/23, 18:17 - Joshua: It can
20/5/23, 18:18 - Joshua: It could
20/5/23, 18:18 - Joshua: I meant
20/5/23, 18:18 - Joshua: We don't know what happens faster than the speed of light
20/5/23, 18:18 - Lucas: Yes
20/5/23, 18:18 - Lucas: So if we r faster
20/5/23, 18:18 - Lucas: There's a possibility of reversing time
20/5/23, 18:18 - Lucas: Or time travel
20/5/23, 18:18 - Joshua: Time slows down as we move faster
20/5/23, 18:19 - Lucas: Then time will have a loophole
20/5/23, 18:19 - Lucas: Then that may be when it tries to revert itself
20/5/23, 18:19 - Lucas: Negativity
20/5/23, 18:19 - Yu Wei Tang: Not possible
20/5/23, 18:19 - Yu Wei Tang: True time dilation,
20/5/23, 18:19 - Lucas: Ik
20/5/23, 18:19 - Yu Wei Tang: However
20/5/23, 18:19 - Lucas: But a machinery
20/5/23, 18:19 - Yu Wei Tang: We cannot reach >the speed of light
20/5/23, 18:19 - Yu Wei Tang: Do
20/5/23, 18:19 - Yu Wei Tang: So
20/5/23, 18:19 - Lucas: Ik
20/5/23, 18:19 - Yu Wei Tang: Time cannot be negative either
20/5/23, 18:20 - Lucas: But we can in a few years
20/5/23, 18:20 - Lucas: .
20/5/23, 18:20 - Yu Wei Tang: No!
20/5/23, 18:20 - Lucas: Hundred
20/5/23, 18:20 - Lucas: Becuz we managed to go faster than sound
20/5/23, 18:20 - Lucas: Which was originally thought to be impossible
20/5/23, 18:20 - Yu Wei Tang: Speed of sound is slower than speed of light
20/5/23, 18:21 - Yu Wei Tang: Thermodynamics say the speed of light is fastest
20/5/23, 18:21 - Joshua: We could
20/5/23, 18:21 - Lucas: Wait
20/5/23, 18:21 - Yu Wei Tang: No Idts...
20/5/23, 18:21 - Lucas: Then how did supernova bend light?
20/5/23, 18:21 - Lucas: Black holes I meant
20/5/23, 18:22 - Joshua: <Media omitted>
20/5/23, 18:22 - Yu Wei Tang: Gravity?
20/5/23, 18:22 - Joshua: Also this the proof that faster than light travel
20/5/23, 18:22 - Lucas: Huh
20/5/23, 18:22 - Joshua: Will cause time travel
20/5/23, 18:23 - Lucas: Idk abt it but I thought it was possible
20/5/23, 18:23 - Lucas: Now
20/5/23, 18:23 - Joshua: Also the name for a theoretical faster than light particle is a Tachyon
20/5/23, 18:23 - Lucas: Tachyon
20/5/23, 18:23 - Lucas: I've heard of that
20/5/23, 18:24 - Lucas: What isot exactly
20/5/23, 18:24 - Lucas: Convert that to kinetic energy
20/5/23, 18:24 - Lucas: Bam
20/5/23, 18:25 - Lucas: The kinetic energy will be insanely high
20/5/23, 18:25 - Yu Wei Tang: Light isn't matter
20/5/23, 18:25 - Joshua: Gravity isn't even energy
20/5/23, 18:25 - Yu Wei Tang: It's a wave
20/5/23, 18:25 - Lucas: Ik
20/5/23, 18:25 - Joshua: It's gravitational potential energy
20/5/23, 18:25 - Yu Wei Tang: So what kinetic energy
20/5/23, 18:25 - Lucas: Around 3 trillion meters per sec
20/5/23, 18:25 - Lucas: Uhm
20/5/23, 18:26 - Lucas: I meant the blackhole
20/5/23, 18:26 - Lucas: Yes that's what I meant
20/5/23, 18:26 - Yu Wei Tang: Kinetic energy of??
20/5/23, 18:26 - Lucas: .
20/5/23, 18:26 - Lucas: Gravitational force is just the force
20/5/23, 18:26 - Lucas: GPS is the amount
20/5/23, 18:27 - Joshua: <Media omitted>
20/5/23, 18:27 - Joshua: This will calculate the energy
20/5/23, 18:27 - Lucas: Layman terms, strength
20/5/23, 18:27 - Yu Wei Tang: Actually can we stop arguing
20/5/23, 18:27 - Lucas: V as in velocity?
20/5/23, 18:27 - Lucas: No
20/5/23, 18:27 - Yu Wei Tang: Just accept
20/5/23, 18:27 - Joshua: As you know energy must be real
20/5/23, 18:27 - Yu Wei Tang: Ppl phones are dying
20/5/23, 18:27 - Lucas: Me and Joshua must make it possible
20/5/23, 18:27 - Yu Wei Tang: Ight
20/5/23, 18:27 - Lucas: So we can finally roast Mr teo
20/5/23, 18:27 - Yu Wei Tang: Then I'll stop arguing
20/5/23, 18:27 - Yu Wei Tang: Consult w Mr teo urself
20/5/23, 18:28 - Lucas: I said there's a gc
20/5/23, 18:28 - Lucas: I made
20/5/23, 18:28 - Lucas: Only 3 of us
20/5/23, 18:28 - Yu Wei Tang: I left
20/5/23, 18:28 - Joshua: Same
20/5/23, 18:28 - Yu Wei Tang: Cus I only have limited storage space
20/5/23, 18:28 - Lucas: Same
20/5/23, 18:28 - Joshua: Unlike @6586965532
20/5/23, 18:28 - Joshua: He has so much
20/5/23, 18:28 - Lucas: But I got 150 gb more
20/5/23, 18:28 - Yu Wei Tang: Like srsly
20/5/23, 18:28 - Yu Wei Tang: I only have <.5gb
20/5/23, 18:28 - Lucas: 5f
20/5/23, 18:28 - Lucas: Tf
20/5/23, 18:28 - Lucas: How
20/5/23, 18:28 - Lucas: Bro
20/5/23, 18:29 - Lucas: U r a legend
20/5/23, 18:29 - Yu Wei Tang: Total my phone only has 64fb
20/5/23, 18:29 - Yu Wei Tang: Gb
20/5/23, 18:29 - Yu Wei Tang: I've seen ppl
20/5/23, 18:29 - Yu Wei Tang: 16gb
20/5/23, 18:29 - Lucas: 256 here
20/5/23, 18:29 - Lucas: 
20/5/23, 18:29 - Joshua: Sane
20/5/23, 18:29 - Joshua: Same
20/5/23, 18:29 - Lucas: Uhm
20/5/23, 18:29 - Joshua: Stop being so rich
20/5/23, 18:30 - Yu Wei Tang: Oh yeah @everyoneelse so sorry for the spam
20/5/23, 18:30 - Joshua: I'm partially sorry
20/5/23, 18:30 - Joshua: But not really
20/5/23, 18:30 - Joshua: and if the velocity of the thing is above the speed of light, v^2/c^2 is more than 1
20/5/23, 18:30 - Lucas: Uhm if we can make a singularity
20/5/23, 18:30 - Joshua: 1-a number more than 1 is negative
20/5/23, 18:31 - Yu Wei Tang: Apologisoh on our behalf
20/5/23, 18:31 - Lucas: Yes
20/5/23, 18:31 - Lucas: Yes
20/5/23, 18:31 - Joshua: The square root of a negative number is imaginary
20/5/23, 18:31 - Joshua: Yes
20/5/23, 18:31 - Lucas: We can make an infinitely dense matter
20/5/23, 18:32 - Lucas: WHICH PROVES INFINITY BEING TRUE
20/5/23, 18:32 - Joshua: And since energy must be real, mc^2 must be imaginary
20/5/23, 18:32 - Lucas: Cause singularity is found in blackholes
20/5/23, 18:32 - Lucas: Also
20/5/23, 18:32 - Joshua: As imaginary/imaginary= real
20/5/23, 18:32 - Lucas: Convert this to kinetic enrgy
20/5/23, 18:32 - Lucas: Ues
20/5/23, 18:32 - Joshua: How
20/5/23, 18:32 - Lucas: Wait no
20/5/23, 18:32 - Lucas: Idk yet
20/5/23, 18:33 - Lucas: But if possible
20/5/23, 18:33 - Joshua: Since c is a constant, m must be imaginary
20/5/23, 18:33 - Lucas: Tachyon is formed
20/5/23, 18:33 - Joshua: Which means mass is negative
20/5/23, 18:33 - Joshua: I meant imaginary
20/5/23, 18:33 - Joshua: It is true
20/5/23, 18:33 - Joshua: It's mass is imaginary
20/5/23, 18:35 - Joshua: And if it's formed, negative time is possible
20/5/23, 18:35 - Joshua: And since distance/time is speed
20/5/23, 18:35 - Joshua: Negative speed is possible
20/5/23, 18:42 - Joshua: Also I apologise for the spamming
20/5/23, 18:46 - Lucas: Yea Joshua it's clear now
20/5/23, 18:48 - Lucas: OH
20/5/23, 18:49 - Lucas: Ok
20/5/23, 18:50 - Lucas: Wait so tachyon is imaginary
20/5/23, 18:50 - Lucas: It's mass is too
20/5/23, 18:50 - Lucas: And speed of light is constant
20/5/23, 18:54 - Joshua: No
20/5/23, 18:55 - Joshua: But the square root of 1-tachyon^2/c^2 is
20/5/23, 19:25 - Lucas: Huh
20/5/23, 19:25 - Lucas: 1 minus tachyon squared over speed of light squared
20/5/23, 19:26 - Jayden Cheng: bro
20/5/23, 19:26 - Jayden Cheng: i thought no math was allowed here
20/5/23, 19:26 - Jayden Cheng: isnt there a seperate chat for that
20/5/23, 19:26 - Lucas: This not math
20/5/23, 19:26 - Lucas: This physics
20/5/23, 19:27 - Joshua: There isn't
20/5/23, 19:27 - Jayden Cheng: bruh
20/5/23, 19:27 - Joshua: Yeah
20/5/23, 19:27 - Jayden Cheng: i thought yall made one
20/5/23, 19:27 - Lucas: And they quit
20/5/23, 19:27 - Jayden Cheng: ah
20/5/23, 19:27 - Jayden Cheng: then why yall typing here
20/5/23, 19:27 - Jayden Cheng: cant yall make a seperate one
20/5/23, 19:27 - Joshua: Because this is physics
20/5/23, 19:27 - Joshua: Not maths
20/5/23, 19:27 - Lucas: J9shua wanna play with ayll
20/5/23, 19:27 - Jayden Cheng: ye but
20/5/23, 19:28 - Jayden Cheng: its spamming my notifs
20/5/23, 19:28 - Lucas: Mute lah
20/5/23, 19:28 - Jayden Cheng: so try not to spamm all
20/5/23, 19:28 - Jayden Cheng: bro what u think ive been doing
20/5/23, 19:28 - Lucas: Also it's necessary
20/5/23, 19:28 - Lucas: We needed to get back at Mr teo
20/5/23, 19:28 - Jayden Cheng: then make a seperate chat
20/5/23, 19:28 - Lucas: By proving that -speed is possible
20/5/23, 19:29 - Jayden Cheng: huh
20/5/23, 19:29 - Jayden Cheng: what
20/5/23, 19:29 - Lucas: Yes
20/5/23, 19:29 - Jayden Cheng: liek why
20/5/23, 19:29 - Lucas: Due to negative time being possoble
20/5/23, 20:08 - Jasson: No, if we make an extra chat for every random topic we talk for too long we'll lose the record for the class with the most used group chat
20/5/23, 20:10 - Kaeleb: hi
20/5/23, 20:11 - Yu Wei Tang: Bye
20/5/23, 20:36 - Joshua: How would you know
20/5/23, 20:40 - Jasson: Inference
20/5/23, 20:40 - Joshua: Where's the evidence
20/5/23, 20:40 - Joshua: Explanation
20/5/23, 20:41 - Joshua: Contextual Knowledge
20/5/23, 20:41 - Joshua: Link
20/5/23, 20:42 - Jasson: According to calculations more than 99% of texts in this chat have been about this random topic
20/5/23, 20:43 - Jasson: Which means that we will have only 1% of our normal texts
20/5/23, 20:44 - Jasson: Which is 20-50 texts per day
20/5/23, 20:44 - Jasson: From my contextual knowledge, most other classes have more than that
20/5/23, 20:46 - Jasson: Hence when getting rid of these dumb messages we will have less texts average than other classes
20/5/23, 20:48 - Jasson: Our insanity, stupidity, incompetence and our lack of logical thinking coupled with the need to win every argument is the only reason why we have this record
20/5/23, 20:49 - Lucas: Wrong, wrong, wrong
20/5/23, 20:49 - Kaeleb: ok
20/5/23, 21:10 - Jasson: What is wrong about it
20/5/23, 21:20 - Lucas: We r smart
20/5/23, 21:21 - Lucas: And um
20/5/23, 21:21 - Lucas: Abit too
20/5/23, 21:23 - Jasson: Fine, some of us are
20/5/23, 21:23 - Jasson: But not you
20/5/23, 21:29 - Lucas: Hmmmm
20/5/23, 21:29 - Lucas: HMMMMMMMM
20/5/23, 21:30 - Lucas: Says u
20/5/23, 21:30 - Lucas: Bro said us when he is the dumbest
20/5/23, 21:51 - Jasson: Hunger games is tomorrow btw
20/5/23, 22:27 - Jasson: Guys, I just did the hunger games
20/5/23, 22:28 - Jasson: I have the screenshots
20/5/23, 22:28 - Jasson: The results are shocking
20/5/23, 22:28 - Jasson: I swear it isn't rigged
20/5/23, 22:38 - Joshua: No
20/5/23, 22:38 - Joshua: I will not approve of this
20/5/23, 22:38 - Joshua: I am still coding my version
20/5/23, 22:43 - Lucas: Sigh
20/5/23, 22:44 - Lucas: I bet this fight ain't worth it

Should we overthrow the dictators holding us back from our rights (admin votes don't count)
OPTION: Yes (3 votes)
OPTION: No (0 votes)

21/5/23, 19:01 - Joshua: Viva la revolution
21/5/23, 19:01 - Jasson: Union!
21/5/23, 19:01 - Jayden Cheng: If yall that mad just make another gc

21/5/23, 19:02 - Jasson: Revolution
21/5/23, 19:03 - Jasson: Fight back
21/5/23, 19:03 - Joshua: Arise ye workers from your slumbers
Arise ye prisoners of want
For reason in revolt now thunders
And at last ends the age of cant.
Away with all your superstitions
Servile masses arise, arise
Well change henceforth the old tradition
And spurn the dust to win the prize.

Refrain:
So comrades, come rally
And the last fight let us face
The Internationale unites the human race.

No more deluded by reaction
On tyrants only well make war
The soldiers too will take strike action
Theyll break ranks and fight no more
And if those cannibals keep trying
To sacrifice us to their pride
They soon shall hear the bullets flying
Well shoot the generals on our own side.

No saviour from on high delivers
No faith have we in prince or peer
Our own right hand the chains must shiver
Chains of hatred, greed and fear
Eer the thieves will out with their booty
And give to all a happier lot.
Each at the forge must do their duty
And well strike while the iron is hot.
21/5/23, 19:04 - Jasson: Rebel!
21/5/23, 19:06 - Jasson: Rise back to those dictators who call us peasants

21/5/23, 19:17 - Jasson: Yes do it
21/5/23, 19:17 - Jasson: I will do
21/5/23, 19:18 - Joshua: Also Cheng En created the chat
21/5/23, 19:18 - Joshua: @6589078600
21/5/23, 19:18 - Joshua: Therefore he has authority
21/5/23, 19:18 - Joshua: More than kaeleb
21/5/23, 19:18 - Jasson: Yes only Cheng En has rights
21/5/23, 19:18 - Joshua: Also didn't @6588781884 say he resigned
21/5/23, 19:18 - Jasson: Everyone else has the same amount of authority as the rest of us
21/5/23, 19:18 - Joshua: Why is he acting like an admin again
21/5/23, 19:19 - Jasson: Yeah dethroned
21/5/23, 19:19 - Joshua: Therefore everything he does is invalid
21/5/23, 19:19 - Jasson: Tru
21/5/23, 19:20 - Jasson: And everyone else pretending they have a higher authority than us
21/5/23, 19:20 - Emma-Joy Lam: bruh you lot really have nothing better to do

21/5/23, 19:21 - Emma-Joy Lam: go study or something
21/5/23, 19:21 - Jasson: You can't say anything I let you back in after society shunned you
21/5/23, 19:21 - Joshua: And everything he does is invalid
21/5/23, 19:21 - Jasson: <Media omitted>
21/5/23, 19:21 - Emma-Joy Lam: this is just a group chat for 13 year olds, its not that deep
21/5/23, 19:22 - Jasson: <Media omitted>
21/5/23, 19:22 - Joshua: Therefore the admins shouldn't have power anymore since they were appointed by kaeleb
21/5/23, 19:22 - Joshua: Also this is just a copy of the one I did
21/5/23, 19:22 - Jasson: We have been wronged

21/5/23, 19:23 - Joshua: Why don't you do the one with 500+ more events
21/5/23, 19:23 - Joshua: Except Cheng En because he created it
21/5/23, 19:23 - Jasson: @6596716538 and me deserve to be in the same power they are
21/5/23, 19:24 - Jasson: Cuz it will have a different outcome

22/5/23, 16:12 - Joshua: I didn't see
22/5/23, 16:13 - Jasson: Why didn't you finish reading everything
22/5/23, 16:17 - Joshua: Because Yes
22/5/23, 16:17 - Joshua: Anyway yesterday I promised I would do hunger games but 510 more events after school in the mrt
22/5/23, 16:17 - Joshua: I'll do it
22/5/23, 16:19 - Joshua: Also, for the people who already know the lore for the first version, I'll be regenerating everything
22/5/23, 16:20 - Joshua: The one where there is a Jasson x Vera arc, where first, Jasson is gay with Jayden, and Vera is thinking about her ex. But then Joshua orders Vera to kill Jasson. She kills Joshua instead. Jasson probably had a crush on Vera after that. Vera then gets into a pretend wedding with Emma Chua. A few days later, Vera kissed Yu Wei, and there was a tsunami then. Then, Jasson catches Yu Wei with a rope, slashes him with a spear, and sets grenades on him. After that, Rheia walks in on Vera and Jasson doing weird and sus things and kills herself in disgust. Vera then attempts to kiss Jasson.
22/5/23, 16:21 - Jasson: WTF
22/5/23, 16:21 - Jasson: It's random
22/5/23, 16:21 - Jasson: We don't talk about that
22/5/23, 16:21 - Joshua: But it generated a cohesive story
22/5/23, 16:23 - Jasson: What?
22/5/23, 16:23 - Jasson: Delete it now
22/5/23, 16:23 - Jasson: It's a family friendly chat
22/5/23, 16:32 - Joshua: Also I forgotten to mention when vera attempts to kiss Jasson, Nathanial died due to blushing so much
22/5/23, 16:32 - Kaeleb: what

22/5/23, 22:34 - Joshua: ~In the hunger games simulator, there is a Jasson x Vera arc, where first, Jasson is gay with Jayden, and Vera is thinking about her ex. But then Joshua orders Vera to kill Jasson. She kills Joshua instead. Jasson probably had a crush on Vera after that. Vera then gets into a pretend wedding with Emma Chua. A few days later, Vera kissed Yu Wei, and there was a tsunami then. Then, Jasson catches Yu Wei with a rope, slashes him with a spear, and sets grenades on him. After that, Rheia walks in on Vera and Jasson doing weird and sus things and kills herself in disgust. Vera then attempts to kiss Jasson. Then, Nathanial died after blushing so much.~

24/5/23, 16:41 - Jasson: All the main characters are female
24/5/23, 16:41 - Jasson: Except the dragon thing
24/5/23, 16:41 - Emma-Joy Lam: So is it sexist against men or women?
24/5/23, 16:41 - Jasson: Which is still stereotyping
24/5/23, 16:41 - Jasson: Both
24/5/23, 16:42 - Emma-Joy Lam: How is a dragon being a male streotyping
24/5/23, 16:42 - Jasson: Treating men differently than women is sexist to both genders
24/5/23, 16:42 - Jasson: Wow
24/5/23, 16:42 - Jasson: Read the sentence you just typed out
24/5/23, 16:43 - Jasson: I'm leaving
24/5/23, 16:43 - Emma-Joy Lam: bro getting mad over my little pony
24/5/23, 16:43 - Jasson: DuckTales 2017 is the best show that ever exists
24/5/23, 16:44 - Jasson: My little pony isn't even your favorite show
24/5/23, 16:45 - Jasson: Also Jim Carrey is one of the best actors of all time
24/5/23, 16:45 - Emma-Joy Lam: then what is my favourite show
24/5/23, 16:45 - Emma-Joy Lam: are you the akinator or something
24/5/23, 16:46 - Jasson: Ace Ventura and the mask is better than the truman show
24/5/23, 16:47 - Jasson: You earlier said Truman is the best show of all time
24/5/23, 16:47 - Jasson: Which is also false
24/5/23, 16:48 - Emma-Joy Lam: best show not my favourite show
24/5/23, 16:49 - Jasson: I know but the fourth best is not the favorite
24/5/23, 16:49 - Jasson: It's either top 3 or 6-21
24/5/23, 16:50 - Jasson: Neil deGrasse Tyson didn't even get a cameo in mlp
24/5/23, 16:53 - Jayden Cheng: Tf
24/5/23, 16:54 - Jasson: DuckTales is the best show of all time
24/5/23, 16:57 - Jasson: The MLP theme song sucks
24/5/23, 16:57 - Jasson: It's so cringe
24/5/23, 17:27 - Yu Wei Tang: I 50% agree
24/5/23, 17:28 - Lucas: I 1200% agree
24/5/23, 17:28 - Jasson: But the DuckTales theme song is so much better
24/5/23, 17:29 - Lucas: Huh
24/5/23, 17:29 - Jasson: Screw you
24/5/23, 17:29 - Lucas: I 2037% disagree

24/5/23, 17:37 - Lucas: Good

24/5/23, 17:37 - Lucas: The lower
24/5/23, 17:37 - Lucas: The better
24/5/23, 17:38 - Jasson: Because the it is in no way better than the DuckTales franchise and the insistence that it is makes me care much less for the franchise

26/5/23, 20:45 - Joshua: Even if it's good, it shouldn't be that expensive
26/5/23, 20:45 - Joshua: Besides most mobile games are free
26/5/23, 20:45 - Jasson: No
26/5/23, 20:45 - Jasson: Not always

26/5/23, 20:48 - Joshua: Are *you* stupid
26/5/23, 20:49 - Jasson: That's cuz some Nintendo games are bad but you can either not buy them or their free
26/5/23, 20:49 - Jasson: Pls don't chose Monday for new date
26/5/23, 20:50 - Joshua: Why

26/5/23, 20:51 - Jasson: But the old one was good
26/5/23, 20:51 - Jasson: Neither of you have the game

28/5/23, 09:14 - Yu Wei Tang: Hi
28/5/23, 09:15 - Lucas: It's 8 14
28/5/23, 09:15 - Yu Wei Tang: Ight noted
28/5/23, 09:15 - Lucas: Ok
28/5/23, 09:18 - Joshua: This is wrong
28/5/23, 09:19 - Joshua: Because you posted this at 9 15 Singapore Standard Time
28/5/23, 09:20 - Joshua: Which is actually 8 15 Western Indonesian Time
28/5/23, 09:20 - Joshua: Which means you are off by 1 minute
28/5/23, 09:23 - Joshua: According to section 415 of the Penal Code of 1871, cheating occurs when a person fraudulently or dishonestly deceives the victim to either hand over property or money to any person, or consent that another person retains his property or money; or
Intentionally induces a deceived victim into either doing anything that he would not do if he had not been deceived, or omitting to do something that he would have done if he had not been deceived. The acts or omissions must also cause, or must be likely to cause, damage or harm to any person in body, mind, reputation or property.
28/5/23, 09:23 - Joshua: You deleted this message
28/5/23, 09:23 - Joshua: You deleted this message
28/5/23, 09:24 - Joshua: You deleted this message
28/5/23, 09:25 - Joshua: Lucas made Yu Wei say "Ight noted" which could have come from the claim where Lucas said "It's 8 14"
28/5/23, 09:25 - Joshua: Therefore, it's a case of cheating
28/5/23, 09:25 - Lucas: Wait
28/5/23, 09:25 - Joshua: The penalty for cheating under section 415 of the Penal Code is a fine and/or imprisonment for up to 3 years.
28/5/23, 09:25 - Lucas: 1. I stated I am in Indonesia yesterday
28/5/23, 09:26 - Lucas: Which meant Yu Wei is not cheating
28/5/23, 09:26 - Lucas: 2. Look at the time stamp
28/5/23, 09:26 - Lucas: It's 8 15 01
28/5/23, 09:26 - Lucas: Due to a lag in system
28/5/23, 09:26 - Joshua: @6586965532 you are already a criminal
28/5/23, 09:26 - Lucas: This is justifiable as I'm using portable wifi
28/5/23, 09:27 - Joshua: What even is that

29/5/23, 18:10 - Joshua: ~Arise ye workers from your slumbers Arise ye prisoners of want For reason in revolt now thunders And at last ends the age of cant. Away with all your superstitions Servile masses arise, arise Well change henceforth the old tradition And spurn the dust to win the prize. Refrain: So comrades, come rally And the last fight let us face The Internationale unites the human race. No more deluded by reaction On tyrants only well make war The soldiers too will take strike action Theyll break ranks and fight no more And if those cannibals keep trying To sacrifice us to their pride They soon shall hear the bullets flying Well shoot the generals on our own side. No saviour from on high delivers No faith have we in prince or peer Our own right hand the chains must shiver Chains of hatred, greed and fear Eer the thieves will out with their booty And give to all a happier lot. Each at the forge must do their duty And well strike while the iron is hot.~

30/5/23, 15:27 - Joshua: It is under Disorderly Behavior in Public
30/5/23, 15:27 - Joshua: A person commits an offence of disorderly behaviour when he or she exhibits annoying or insulting behaviour in any public place, place of public amusement or resort, or in or nearby any court, public office, police station or place of worship.

30/5/23, 15:28 - Joshua: This chat is a public place

31/5/23, 18:04 - Joshua: Either
31/5/23, 18:05 - Jasson: Cuz the only things we talk about is random garbage
31/5/23, 18:07 - Elizabeth: whats wrong with that
31/5/23, 18:07 - Jasson: I'd rather not be here
31/5/23, 18:08 - Jasson: I'm almost done binge watching Brooklyn 99 for the 18th time and I'm addicted to candy crush now
31/5/23, 18:09 - Joshua: No one cares about Brooklyn 99
31/5/23, 18:09 - Joshua: I don't even know what it is
31/5/23, 18:09 - Jasson: Cuz you're a dumpster living mealworm
31/5/23, 18:10 - Joshua: Shut up
31/5/23, 18:11 - Joshua: Also
31/5/23, 18:12 - Jasson: Yes?
31/5/23, 18:12 - Joshua: Jasson x Emma-Joy
31/5/23, 18:12 - Joshua: Is a good ship
31/5/23, 18:12 - Jasson: Why would you go back to an old ship
31/5/23, 18:13 - Joshua: Because it makes sense
31/5/23, 18:13 - Jasson: Joshua  Jayden
31/5/23, 18:13 - Jasson: You never go back to an old ship
31/5/23, 18:14 - Jasson: It makes you look like a rookie
31/5/23, 18:14 - Jasson: What part
31/5/23, 18:15 - Joshua: @6589078600
31/5/23, 18:16 - Joshua: Proof
31/5/23, 18:16 - Jasson: That was so long ago
31/5/23, 18:16 - Jasson: And that's cuz @6596673980 doesn't understand human interaction
31/5/23, 18:17 - Joshua: Then how is he vice chair
31/5/23, 18:18 - Jasson: Because like all politics it's always a popularity contest
31/5/23, 18:18 - Joshua: Then how is Rheia chair
31/5/23, 18:19 - Joshua: Higher ranked than ban mee
31/5/23, 18:19 - Joshua: And how are Lucas and Ethan in the class committee @6589078600
31/5/23, 18:20 - Jasson: Why are we even talking about this
31/5/23, 18:20 - Jasson: Because they were one of the idiots that volunteered
31/5/23, 18:20 - Jasson: No one else wanted the job
31/5/23, 18:21 - Joshua: Did you volunteer
31/5/23, 18:21 - Jasson: No
31/5/23, 18:21 - Joshua: Same
31/5/23, 18:22 - Jasson: I need the leadership thing tho so I'll probably volunteer next year
31/5/23, 18:22 - Joshua: Why you need
31/5/23, 18:22 - Jasson: Idk, the ministry of education people want us to
31/5/23, 18:23 - Joshua: Infocomn would already give you a leadership role automatically in sec 3
31/5/23, 18:23 - Jasson: It will help with stuff
31/5/23, 18:24 - Joshua: Like what
31/5/23, 18:25 - Jasson: You should probably take up some responsibility since you can't go for competitions and your conduct's probably going to be bad cuz of the demerit points
31/5/23, 18:25 - Yu Wei Tang: Tmr ban lee will lose money right
31/5/23, 18:25 - Jasson: Yeah
31/5/23, 18:25 - Jasson: Obviously
31/5/23, 18:25 - Joshua: I can go next year
31/5/23, 18:25 - Yu Wei Tang: Wait how much is he buying
31/5/23, 18:25 - Jasson: Idk
31/5/23, 18:25 - Joshua: Imagine going
31/5/23, 18:26 - Jasson: Free
31/5/23, 18:26 - Joshua: For competitions
31/5/23, 18:26 - Joshua: My parents don't want me to go anyway
31/5/23, 18:26 - Jasson: You'll still have horrible conduct
31/5/23, 18:26 - Joshua: I can try to behave next year
31/5/23, 18:27 - Joshua: After all, I haven't gotten any demerit points since early April
31/5/23, 18:27 - Elizabeth: uhm
31/5/23, 18:27 - Yu Wei Tang: Ain't that what we going for
31/5/23, 18:28 - Jasson: Brooklyn nine nine is the second best show of all time though
31/5/23, 18:28 - Joshua: No
31/5/23, 18:29 - Yu Wei Tang: Desc it in 5 words
31/5/23, 18:29 - Joshua: You deleted this message
31/5/23, 18:30 - Joshua: Very stupid, dumb, and lame
31/5/23, 18:31 - Yu Wei Tang: I asked Jasson
31/5/23, 18:31 - Joshua: And he came up with a stupid reason
31/5/23, 18:31 - Jasson: Best sitcom of all time
31/5/23, 18:32 - Joshua: I can predict what was to come
31/5/23, 18:32 - Joshua: Wow
31/5/23, 18:32 - Joshua: Worst*
31/5/23, 18:33 - Joshua: Could*
31/5/23, 18:33 - Joshua: I'm a fortune teller
31/5/23, 18:33 - Joshua: Wow
31/5/23, 18:33 - Christopher: Wat
31/5/23, 18:34 - Jasson: I hope you drown in a bathtub and your windpipe fills up with water causing your lungs to fill with blood flooding your lungs and spilling in your tub causing you to drown in your own blood
31/5/23, 18:34 - Joshua: Do you think Brooklyn nine nine is stupid
31/5/23, 18:34 - Joshua: I'm going to see how much you will be charged
31/5/23, 18:35 - Jasson: No
31/5/23, 18:35 - Jasson: I'm leaving
31/5/23, 18:35 - Jasson: Bye
31/5/23, 18:35 - Joshua: Like what I did with thiam
31/5/23, 18:35 - Jasson: I didn't drown you
31/5/23, 18:35 - Jasson: You drowned yourself
31/5/23, 18:36 - Joshua: But you made that comment
31/5/23, 18:37 - Joshua: A death threat
31/5/23, 18:38 - Joshua: This falls under Criminal intimidation
31/5/23, 18:39 - Joshua: Under Section 503 of the 1871 penal code
31/5/23, 18:39 - Joshua: Whoever threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation of any one in whom that person is interested, with intent to cause alarm to that person, or to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat, commits criminal intimidation .
31/5/23, 18:39 - Yu Wei Tang: What...
31/5/23, 18:40 - Yu Wei Tang: Anyone wanna wear class tee tmr
31/5/23, 18:40 - Joshua: Jasson threatened me with injury
31/5/23, 18:40 - Jasson: No
31/5/23, 18:40 - Jasson: I'm not wearing it in public
31/5/23, 18:40 - Yu Wei Tang: Man
31/5/23, 18:41 - Yu Wei Tang: But sure
31/5/23, 18:41 - Joshua: According to section 506 of the penal code 1871, whoever commits the offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both; and if the threat is to cause death or grievous hurt, or to cause the destruction of any property by fire, or to cause an offence punishable with death or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years or more, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with both.
31/5/23, 18:41 - Jasson: No I threatened you with a slow painful death
31/5/23, 18:41 - Joshua: Yeah
31/5/23, 18:41 - Joshua: That still falls under criminal intimidation though
31/5/23, 18:42 - Joshua: As it is to cause death, you will be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or both
31/5/23, 18:43 - Joshua: Since the fine limit is not mentioned, I won't give you a fine and send you to prison for 10 years

31/5/23, 21:25 - Joshua: That's true
31/5/23, 21:26 - Joshua: Also I remember you spelled Amelia Earhart as Amelia Airhart last Friday

7/6/23, 18:49 - Lucas: 
7/6/23, 21:05 - Kaeleb: Hmm
7/6/23, 21:10 - Joshua: Time to do the democracy test for this group chat to see if it's a democracy or an authoritarian state
7/6/23, 21:10 - Joshua: 1. Are elections for the national legislature and head of government free?
Consider whether elections are competitive in that electors are free to vote and
are offered a range of choices.
1: Essentially unrestricted conditions for the presentation of candidates (for
example, no bans on major parties)
0.5: There are some restrictions on the electoral process
0: A single-party system or major impediments exist (for example, bans on a
major party or candidate)
7/6/23, 21:11 - Joshua: I'll give 0 because there are no elections we get to take part in
7/6/23, 21:12 - Joshua: In fact, since there are no elections at all, I'll give 0 for every question which asks about them
7/6/23, 21:14 - Joshua: So that means 0 for most questions in section 1
7/6/23, 21:15 - Joshua: If they are not 0, I will write them down:
11. Is potential access to public office open to all citizens?
1: Yes
0.5: Formally unrestricted, but in practice restricted for some groups, or for
citizens from some parts of the country
0: No
7/6/23, 21:15 - Joshua: I'll give it 0.5
7/6/23, 21:17 - Joshua: So this group chat gets a 0.5/12 for Electoral process and
pluralism
7/6/23, 21:17 - Joshua: Next section
7/6/23, 21:18 - Joshua: Question 13 about elections so 0
7/6/23, 21:19 - Joshua: 14. Is the legislature the supreme political body, with a clear supremacy over
other branches of government?
7/6/23, 21:19 - Joshua: 0 because no legislature
7/6/23, 21:19 - Joshua: Except for me arresting Lucas and Jasson
7/6/23, 21:20 - Joshua: 16. Government is free of undue influence by the military or the security
services
1: Yes
0.5: Influence is low, but the defence minister is not a civilian. If the current risk
of a military coup is extremely low, but the country has a recent history of
military rule or coups
0: No
17. Foreign powers do not determine important government functions or
policies
1: Yes
0.5: Some features of a protectorate
0: No (significant presence of foreign troops; important decisions taken by
foreign power; country is a protectorate)
18. Special economic, religious or other powerful domestic groups do not
exercise significant political power, parallel to democratic institutions?
1: Yes
0.5: Exercise some meaningful influence
0: No
7/6/23, 21:20 - Joshua: All these questions is 1
7/6/23, 21:21 - Joshua: 19 is elections so 0
7/6/23, 21:23 - Joshua: 20 and 21 is 1
7/6/23, 21:23 - Joshua: 22. How pervasive is corruption?
1: Corruption is not a major problem
0.5: Corruption is a significant issue
0: Pervasive corruption exists
23. Is the civil service willing and capable of implementing government policy?
1: Yes
0.5. Yes, but serious flaws exist
0: No
7/6/23, 21:23 - Joshua: 22: 1
23: 0.5
7/6/23, 21:24 - Joshua: 24. Popular perceptions of the extent to which they have free choice and control
over their lives
1: High
0.5: Moderate
0: Low
If available, from World Values Survey
% of people who think that they have a great deal of choice/control
1 if more than 70%
0.5 if 50-70%
0 if less than 50%
25. Public confidence in government
1: High
0.5: Moderate
0: Low
If available, from World Values Survey
% of people who have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in
government
1 if more than 40%
0.5 if 25-40%
0 if less than 25%
26. Public confidence in political parties
1: High
0.5: Moderate
7/6/23, 21:24 - Joshua: All are 0.5
7/6/23, 21:27 - Joshua: Electoral process and plualism: 0.5/12
